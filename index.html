            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>I’m characterized as cool, cute, loyal, sweet, friendly, mysterious, unique, determined, yet sensitive,
                boyish and impetuous.

                I was born intellectually challenged, which makes me: somewhat socially awkward, misunderstood,
                unpredictable and a little multidimensional. But I’m really smart, knowledgeable, independent,
                compassionate and driven. Not to mention I can also be quite observant.

                At times, I can be a little serious, moody, irritable, lazy, rude, selfish, arrogant, stubborn, jealous,
                narcissistic, clueless, forgetful, sneaky, aggressive, impulsive, immature, cynical, mischievous,
                intimidating, obsessive and a bit downtrodden. I can also sometimes be a bit of a perfectionist as well
                as being an imitator and follower. I even occasionally wear all my emotions on my sleeve. There are also
                times when I can be a little gullible, trusting, a bit submissive and meek as well as being indecisive
                and withdrawn. While I’m prone to be a little touchy about certain things, I do tend to have a bit of an
                annoying side, since some of my actions tend to be bothersome to some people and I kinda struggle to
                give some space, but most of it was done unintentional. I am even shown to sometimes have a bit of a
                darker side, despite my harmless persona. I can also sometimes be real hard on myself whenever I said or
                did something wrong, which often times make me repentant. I sometimes tend to act and/or say without
                thinking</p>

        <h3>Wishes</h3>
        <p>I actually had my dream come true. It just took me a while to realize it.

            One night, I dreamed of the pasture just west and across the street from my house. There was the old barn as
            I remembered it. In the pasture, there was a bay horse. That is a horse with a brown coat and black mane,
            tail, and lower legs. It had a star on its forehead, a bit of white, a snip, on its nose, and two white hind
            socks. I think I was just about to pet its nose, which not all horses like, when I woke up.

            Several years later, after looking at several horses, I got to this farm to look at a horse that was
            advertised.
